## Assignment Solver

This tool lets you snip any region of your screen, extract the text (OCR), and feed it to an AI model to generate an answer. I originally built it using the Davinci-002 API back when ChatGPT didn’t exist, to quickly solve/accelerate college assignments with minimal effort. A sample assignment is included to show how this tool helps complete work easily.

Today, you don’t even need a paid GPT API: you can connect this to any open-source LLM for answer generation.

### How it works
- Snip a region of the screen to capture the question
- OCR the image to extract text
- Send the extracted text to an LLM endpoint and display the answer
